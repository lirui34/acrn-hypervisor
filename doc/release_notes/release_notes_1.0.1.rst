ACRN v1.0.1 (July 2019)
#######################

We are pleased to announce the release of ACRN version 1.0.1. It is a maintenance
release of v1.0 mainly for security fixes. It's off of the release_1.0 branch rather
than master branch that most of ACRN releases are base on.

ACRN is a flexible, lightweight reference hypervisor that's built with real-time and safety-criticality
in mind and is optimized to streamline embedded development through an open source platform.
Check out :ref:`introduction` for more information. All project ACRN source code is maintained in the
https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor repository and includes folders for the ACRN hypervisor,
the ACRN device model, tools, and documentation. You can either download this source code as a zip or tar.gz file
(see the `ACRN v1.0.1 GitHub release page <https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor/releases/tag/v1.0.1>`_)
or use the following Git clone and checkout commands::

   $ git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor
   $ cd acrn-hypervisor
   $ git checkout v1.0.1

The projectâ€™s online technical documentation is also tagged to correspond with a specific release:
generated v1.0.1 documents can be found at https://projectacrn.github.io/1.0.1/.
